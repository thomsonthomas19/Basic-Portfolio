            About Me

        <p>This page has a heading that implies it is about me but this is actually false. This can be observed from the 
            image near the top of the page. While that is ideally supposed to be an image of me, it is in fact that of a cat.
            What is the story surrounding that cat? How many times has its image been used, and for how many different 
            purposes? Such a miniscule yet significant thing, and it has no idea. Is that cat even still alive? Maybe
            its soul left the earth long ago and this photo is all that remains of it.
        </p>

            I need a second paragraph but don't want to talk about the cat anymore so I'm going to list some fruit. 
            Apple Banana Orange Lemon Grapefruit Tangerine Raspberry Pumpkin Lime Tomatillo Dragonfruit Grape Plum Peach
            Cranberry Star fruit Blueberry Cucumber Pomegranate Cherry Durian Coconut Blackberry Tomato Fig Mango Honeydew Watermelon Olive Passionfruit
            Nectarine Pear Cantaloupe Clementine Kiwi Guava.
